## 2024-05-23 - Arrow Key Navigation for Tabs
**Learning:** In TUI applications, spatial mapping of arrow keys (Left/Right) to horizontally arranged tabs is significantly more intuitive than arbitrary letter hotkeys (like 'P'/'S'), as it aligns with the user's mental model of the layout and reduces cognitive load.
**Action:** Always map arrow keys to spatial UI elements (Tabs, Grids) in TUI designs.
